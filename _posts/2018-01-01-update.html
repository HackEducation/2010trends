<p>I&#8217;ve made some changes to this site, most obviously updating the header image. <a href="http://bryanmmathers.com/">Thanks to Bryan Mathers</a>. (<a href="http://pigeons.hackeducation.com/">Why a pigeon</a>? You can read more here.)</p>

<p>Those who look closely will also note that I have changed the copyright notification on this website. No longer is there a Creative Commons license on Hack Education. This really doesn&#8217;t change anything, I promise. <em>It just means you have to ask my permission</em>. If you wish to reprint my writing, please contact me directly.</p>
